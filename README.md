# Web Form Validation Study

This repository contains the three HTML form versions used in the user study:

- Inline Validation (form_inline.html)
- Error Summary (form_summary.html)
- Assistive Auto-Correct (form_autocorrect.html)

These files were created for the form error-handling experiment described in the report for EECS 4441.
The pages can be opened locally in any modern browser.
